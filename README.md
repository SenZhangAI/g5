# g8 : it works in progress, stay tuned~
Implement a **g**olang compiler and minimal runtime environment within **8** functions. Inspired by [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) project. To compile it, we need a modern compiler, that is, it should support cpp17 language standard.(Recommend to use msvc2017 or gcc7.0).

*ps: code commit might be frequent, you can star it rather watching.*
